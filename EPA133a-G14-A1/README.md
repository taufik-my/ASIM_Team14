## 📌 Assignment Overview

This repository contains the submission for **Assignment 1: Data Quality Issues for Data-Driven Simulation**.

The objective of this assignment is to assess and improve the quality of the Bangladesh road and bridge datasets to ensure their suitability for simulation use.

The cleaned datasets generated in this assignment are later used in subsequent simulation tasks.

## ▶ How to Run the Code

The **main notebook** is:

```
notebook/Notebook Group 14.ipynb
```

This notebook:

* Loads the raw road and bridge datasets
* Performs preprocessing and restructuring
* Applies data quality checks
* Detects and repairs spatial outliers
* Exports cleaned datasets to:

```
data/processed/
```

The other notebooks (`Chainage_monotony`, `Check_boundary_with_shp`, `Fixing_road`) were used during task division and intermediate development.
They are not required to reproduce the final results.

To reproduce the analysis:

Run `Notebook Group 14.ipynb` from top to bottom.

## 🖥 Visualization in Java Simulation

To visualize the cleaned infrastructure in the provided Java simulation:

1. Use the original folder:

```
WBSIM_Lab1_2024
```

⚠️ **Important:**
Use the original `WBSIM_Lab1_2024` folder (NOT the cleaned version).
This folder is not included in this repository due to size limitations.
It is assumed that the teaching assistants have access to it.

1. Navigate to:

```
WBSIM_Lab1_2024/infrastructure/
```

3. Replace the existing infrastructure data with the cleaned files from:

```
EPA133a-G14-A1/data/processed/
```

4. Run the Java simulation as instructed in the course materials.

The simulation will then use the cleaned road network.

## 📄 Report

The LaTeX report can be found in:

```
report/
```

The compiled PDF summarizes:

* Data quality assessment
* Cleaning methodology
* Results and validation
* Simulation integration

---

## 🧠 Notes

* The cleaning algorithm improves geometric consistency but does not guarantee correction of all anomalies.
* The cleaned data preserves structural integrity required for simulation use.
* All preprocessing steps are fully reproducible via the main notebook.
